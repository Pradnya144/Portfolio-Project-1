## Design

### Colour

Keeping in mind the purpose of this website, I have chosen colors close to the ocean and the beach. The background on most pages is Caribbean blue. I have used a font color similar to Ivory to give a good contrast. The fonts over white background is again a different sharde of blue, in orer to manintain contrast and the theme.
I knew I wanted to go with the whole water and ocean theme, so I used googles search engine to help me find some suitable color palettes.

### Font

I have used https://fonts.google.com/ for my fonts. I have chosen to use Playfair Display as my main font throughout the website. This is a fairly modern style that is easy to read at various sizes. To increase the readability, I have increased the font sizes at various occasions.

I have used the font Lobster in the header for the website name as it has an underwater kind of feel to it.

I imported the following code into the top of my style.css file

````
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lobster&display=swap&family=Playfair+Display&display=swap');
````

### Images

All the images for the website are from https://unsplash.com/. I wanted to keep the hero image very basic, yet very vibrant and inviting, with a large area of base color and not very cluttered. 

The I chose a variety of images for the gallery section, some with just planted fish tanks, some with fresh water fishes and some with marine fishes in order to try and display all the things this business offers.

### Wireframe

I have used balsamiq to create layout mockup of how the website would look. Being the developer and designer of the website, wireframes helped arrange different elements on the webpage to see what appeals the most visually.
