## User Experience (UX)

### User Story

### Structure

The website consists of 3 pages.

* A landing page/home page with a section having brief description of the business and links to the Photo Gallery and Contact form.
* A Gallery page displaying the highlights of the projects done by the business.
* A Contact page having a fill out form for enquiries and a map showing the location to the store along with store timings.


## Design

### Colour

Keeping in mind the purpose of this website, I have chosen colors close to the ocean and the beach. The background on most pages is Caribbean blue. I have used a font color similar to Ivory to give a good contrast. The fonts over white background is again a different sharde of blue, in orer to manintain contrast and the theme.
I knew I wanted to go with the whole water and ocean theme, so I used googles search engine to help me find some suitable color palettes.
